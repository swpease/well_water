```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```


```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
```

```{r}
all_data = readr::read_csv("/Users/Scott/QGIS/SVI/Penn_Analysis/data/final_output.csv")
```

remove that Lake Erie (the literal lake) tract:
```{r}
all_data <- all_data |> filter(!is.na(COUNTY))
```


Should pop density be based on land area only, or total area (i.e. including water area as well)?
```{r}
all_data = all_data |> 
  mutate(
    pop_density = E_TOTPOP / ALAND,
    pop_density_alt = E_TOTPOP / (ALAND + AWATER),
    )
```

An alternative rurality estimate is the binary classification provided by the Center for Rural PA: https://www.rural.pa.gov/download.cfm?file=Resources/PDFs/data/List%20of%20Counties%20web%202022.xlsx


```{r}

```
